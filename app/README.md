# Siddhant Gautam's Personal Web Page
Welcome to my personal web page! This is where I'll be listing the current things I'm working on, sharing my thoughts on various topics (think of it as a blog), and maintaining an online resume.

## Current Projects
* Chat App: Ah the good old never-before-done chat app project. I am working on this project with two of my close friends. Maybe I can add some no trivial features to it so I can describe it as something cool here later on. :)
 
## Blog
I'll be using this space to share my thoughts on various topics that interest me, mostly all things tech, and maybe sometimes just the things on my mind. Stay tuned for some interesting reads (I hope)!

## Online Resume
If you're interested in my professional background and experience, you can check out my resume linked in the page. It includes my education, work history, and skills, as well as some examples of my previous projects.
